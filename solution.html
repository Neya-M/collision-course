		<p>According to Newton's 1st law, an object will not change its motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This means that the asteroid will collide with Earth in 20 years unless we push or pull it somehow.</p>
		<p>Newton's second law is the equation "Force = mass * acceleration." To find the mass, we can multiply the volume by the density. With a diameter of 150 meters, the volume is around 14.1 million cubic meters. Multiply this by the density (~8000 kg/m³) and you get a mass of about 113.1 billion kilograms. So to make the asteroid accelerate at 1 m/s², you would need about 113.1 billion Newtons of force.</p>
		<p>Because of Newton's 3rd law, the molten rock shooting out from the asteroid will push back on the asteroid and move it just a bit. Over lots of time, this will change the motion enough to save Earth!</p>
